The tornado remained a multi-vortex circulation as it moved into the county producing high end damage for much of its remaining path.  The tornado encountered several houses in the vicinity of Fontanelle Road and 320th Street.  Many of the structures received at least EF2 damage with one house north of the intersection receiving up to EF4 damage with a sufficiently anchored structure destroyed and slumped into a debris field nearby.  Additional EF4 damage was noted at a farmstead on Jordan Avenue south of 280th Street with the house destroyed and trees chewed down to only the largest trucks and portions of the bark removed.  The path then passed through another wind mill area with additional turbines collapsing west of Kent Avenue.  The tornado then passed over Nodaway Park Ponds and entered the southwest side of Greenfield along SW 3rd Street.  Several structures over the next several blocks had up to EF4 damage from SW 3rd Street over the SE 3rd Street and South of Linn Street and north of Oak and Noble Streets.   Most of these saw complete destruction of the house with much of the debris scattered in the area but not completely swept away.  The tornado weakened slightly for the later half of the destructive path through Greenfield.  EF3 damage was widespread from SE Kent Street and SE 4th Street to the Intersection of E Iowa Street and NE 8th Street.  The tornado exited the east side of Greenfield near the Adair County Fairgrounds.  The tornado continued east northeast and gradually weakened impacting a few more houses before dissipating just south of the intersection of 220th Street and Quebec Avenue.  This tornado produced at least 35 injuries in addition to 4 deaths within Greenfield.  All of the deaths occurred in homes.  Of note, according to media reports, a Doppler on Wheels (DOW) intercept research team measured a wind speed of just over 300 mph approximately 150 feet above ground level with this tornado.","PLEASE NOTE, for hail, wind, heavy rain and flooding, please see separate Storm Data entry for May 20-22. ||Numerous tornadoes occurred on this day with numerous injuries and four fatalities at Greenfield in Adair County.||Multiple rounds of thunderstorms brought torrential rainfall, damaging winds, hail and destructive tornadoes to the state. These thunderstorms were the result of a low pressure system which lifted north into the area on the night of May 20th, 2024, producing slow moving storms that dropped 2 to 4 inches of rainfall. This resulted in flash flooding over portions of northern and central Iowa through the morning of May 21st, 2024.||Following the heavy rainfall through the morning, skies cleared out ahead of an approaching cold front. By the afternoon hours of May 21st, 2024, this cold front produced a line of strong thunderstorms which produced multiple strong tornadoes throughout the state, including one which led to significant damage in the town of Greenfield, IA, among other locations. This line of storms also produced damaging winds, leading to widespread tree damage and power outages throughout the forecast area.",1

It curved north then northwest before making a complete loop northwest of Greensburg.  Thus, the path was 25.8 miles.||This tornado destroyed nearly 95 percent of the town of Greensburg and despite adequate warning, unfortunately took the life of 11 people, some that were in basements.  First responders arriving on the scene requested three refrigerated refer trucks thinking there would be hundreds of fatalities. It also destroyed a dozen homes and a church south of Greensburg but did not cause injury.  In all, 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage. ||As the tornado was dissipating it turned northwest, west, south and then back east making a loop.  This was documented on both high resolution doppler radar and through the ground survey.  Also as the tornado was dissipating a new circulation quickly grew northeast of town.||Several oil storage tanks were destroyed causing an environmental concern.  In the town of Greensburg, hazardous material was strewn everywhere.  As of July 26th, the debris was still not fully cleaned up.  Two landfills were filled with debris from the town and this was even as most was burned.  Hundreds of thousands of dump truck loads were taken out.  It was estimated that approximately 400,000 cubic yards of debris was removed.  The major highway running through town was closed for 1 full month.||At one time there were over 150 law enforcement officers (from all over the country) present.  Military was called in for debris removal and rebuilding. ||Damage of insured losses exceeded $150 million, but including un-insured losses, was roughly 250 million dollars.||**** NOTE **** The 11th victim passed away on September 19th, 2007 after a long battle with a head injury sustained during the tornado.","A destructive tornado, the first 5 rating on the new Enhanced-Fujita Scale and the first 5 classification since May 3, 1999 when an F5 tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma occurred on this day.  There were 16 tornadoes during about a 4 hour period, one a little over 2 miles wide! Two of the tornadoes existed for over 1 hour as they churned up the ground, leveling homes and causing fatalities along their path.  Miraculously, on 13 people perished, 11 in Greensburg - a miracle because over 90 percent of the town of Greensburg was literately wiped off the face of the earth. ||Another round of tornadoes occurred the following day across generally the same area.  Nearly 250 pivot irrigation sprinklers were damaged or destroyed during the 2 day outbreak.  Due to the number of sprinklers involved and the lack of replacements, some farmers would be out of service for over 1 year.",82

Maximum winds were estimated to have exceeded 200 miles per hour. The tornado had a maximum width of one mile and an overall path length of nearly 21.6 miles, nearly nine miles of which occurred in Jasper County.||The tornado killed 158 directly, three indirectly, and injured over 1150 people.  Sadly, on May 24 a police officer who was volunteering from another department, was struck by lightning while serving in the response efforts and later died.  Equally, a 56 year old man who had been included as a direct fatality was later determined to have died of a heart attack.  Over 10,200 people filed for disaster assistance following the tornado.||The EF-5 rating (greater than 200 mph wind speeds) was mainly arrived at by the total destruction of vehicles, including some vehicles tossed several blocks and semi trucks thrown a quarter of a mile. Parking stops weighing over 300 pounds and re-barred into asphalt were uprooted and tossed.  Other factors in the rating included damage to reinforced concrete structures, and that St. John���s Hospital building structure was compromised.  ||Seven thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed and another 900 damaged.  Other substantial buildings damaged or destroyed included the Joplin High School and Technical Center along with five other city schools.  Numerous retailers including Home Depot, Sports Academy, Dillons, and Walmart were also destroyed.  The most substantial building impacted was St John's hospital which will be razed due to the tornado.  It was calculated that 2 million cubic yards of debris is attributable to the storm across its relatively short length on the ground.||The tornado initially touched down one half mile southwest of the intersection of JJ Highway and Newton Road in Newton County where several large trees were toppled. ||The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved toward the intersection of Country Club Drive and 32nd Street where it crossed into Jasper County. Damage became more widespread as the tornado crossed Maiden Lane, breaking nearly all windows on three sides of St. Johns Hospital as well as damage to the roof and exterior walls on several floors.  Two patients on oxygen were indirectly suffocated when the generator and a backup generator were damaged after power was cut off.  Three additional patients may have succumbed similarly though sufficient data as to the cause of death was not available.  An additional indirect fatality occurred due to psychological trauma.||The tornado further intensified as it destroyed homes and businesses to the immediate east and north of the hospital. A church school was completely destroyed with the exception of a portion of the sanctuary.  Significant damage to the Greenbriar Nursing Home resulted in the death of 20 mostly elderly patients.  ||The tornado continued to destroy hundreds of frame homes between 32nd and 20th Streets, leading to nearly a fifth of the deaths. Three story apartment complexes had the top two floors removed; other two story complexes were partially leveled. Fourteen deaths occurred in apartments along the track.  Eleven additional deaths occurred in churches along this path.  There were two fatalities in a mobile home (Joplin has a city ordinance prohibiting mobile home parks). ||Well built structures that were heavily damaged or destroyed along this area included the Joplin High School, Franklin Technical Center and Irving Elementary, all of which were free of students due to the weekend.  The tornado also damaged three additional elementary schools.  A bank was totally destroyed with the exception of the vault. A large grocery store was also destroyed.  ||The tornado crossed Rangeline Road near 20th Street. Damage included significant to complete damage to several restaurants and large long-span retail buildings; including Home Depot, Sports Academy and Walmart in this area.  Twenty deaths occurred indoors or in the parking lots of these structures.  Semi trucks on the back side of Walmart were thrown more than a quarter mile.||The tornado continued to move eastward along and south of 20th Street destroying numerous warehouse style facilities, a portion of Joplin East Middle School, and residences through Duquesne Road.||The tornado continued destroying numerous homes as it began weakening. It turned southeast toward Interstate 44 where it threw several semi trucks as it crossed the interstate and moved into Newton County at 32nd Street just west of Kodiak Road.","A strong upper level trough across the central plains region and a strong upper level disturbance along with a frontal boundary in the area produced numerous severe storms with a few supercells across southeast Kansas. One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma. ||Continuing thunderstorms lasted into May 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.",308

The tornado entered Tuscaloosa County just north of CR 60, west northwest of Ralph, and moved northeast causing tree damage and minor structural damage consistent with an EF2 rating and winds of 125 mph. The tornado strengthened as it crossed the Black Warrior River, north of Interstate 20 and approached Tuscaloosa. As the tornado approached Interstate 359, several buildings were destroyed including the Tuscaloosa County Emergency Operations Center. The tornado strengthened further to a violent EF4 with winds of 190 mph. Along 15th St E. and McFarland Blvd E., several small restaurants and stores were destroyed, with only a wall or two still standing. The tornado devastated the Cedar Crest neighborhood just north of 15th St, leveling many cinder block homes and causing at least 3 fatalities. The tornado crossed McFarland Blvd, destroying additional stores and restaurants. The tornado crossed University Blvd in the Alberta City community. Alberta Elementary School suffered nearly complete destruction, with only a few portions of walls still standing. A nearby two story apartment building was reduced to rubble sitting on the foundation. The Alberta Park Shopping Center was completely destroyed with no walls standing and a pile of debris on the foundation. Cinder block construction homes in the surrounding neighborhood were completely destroyed, and in a few cases debris was swept away from the site. The tornado continued northeast and struck the Chastain Manor Apartments at the north end of 34th Ave E. Buildings on the east side of this new 2 story apartment complex were completely destroyed, with only a pile of debris remaining and a few walls set into the hillside. A small club house that was anchored to a foundation, but with apparently no interior walls, was completely destroyed and swept from its foundation. Similar devastation to homes and businesses was noted along both sides of CR 45 near 1st St E. and locations to the northeastward. East of Holt, the tornado path width widened from 0.5 mile to around 1 mile. The tornado crossed Holt Peterson Rd just northwest of Clinker Rd, where two homes were completely destroyed. One home on a foundation was swept clean, with only floor joists remaining attached to the foundation. Almost all trees were blown down or snapped in the vicinity, as well as in the bottom of a narrow ravine nearly 100 feet below the house. The tornado continued to Holt Lock and Dam Road near its intersection with Recreation Area Road. Numerous mobile homes and several cinder block homes were destroyed in this area, which resulted in several fatalities. The tornado struck a marina on Holt Lake at the end of Recreation Area Road where it caused significant damage to a restaurant as well as numerous boats. Several injuries were noted in this area. The tornado continued northeastward and weakened to an EF3 rating with winds of 130 mph. As its path narrowed to 0.5 mile, the tornado passed north of Brookwood, near the intersection of Hannah Creek Rd and CR 59. Several mobile homes were destroyed, cinder block homes received heavy damage, and significant tree damage was noted in this area. The tornado moved parallel to Hannah Creek Rd where it caused extensive tree damage and destroyed at least one mobile home. The tornado crossed CR 99 and moved into western Jefferson County, 4 miles north of Abernant. A person died (indirect) several weeks after the event as a result of contracting pneumonia from exposure to the elements after his home was destroyed. An additional 6 people died (indirect) in the months following the tornado from the stress of the event, not direct injury.||This tornado was produced by a supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County Mississippi at 13:54 pm CST, finally dissipating in Macon County, North Carolina at approximately 21:18 pm CST. This supercell spawned several strong to violent tornadoes along its long path.","A powerful storm system crossed the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011, resulting in a large and deadly tornado outbreak.  This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

The tornado began northwest of Macksburg in western Madision county.  The tornado remained in mostly rural cropland and wooded areas of western Madison county.  The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado.  Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road.  Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road.  The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation.  After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92.  Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage.  From Highway 92 to where the tornado exited the county, it remained mostly in rural cropland and wooded areas with numerous trees impacted.  The tornado then moved into Warren county from Madison county.","On March 5, 2022 a total of 15 tornadoes occurred across the state of Iowa as a warm front lifted across the area. Supercells initially developed across southwest Iowa in the vicinity of the triple point of the surface low with strong, rotating updrafts. Longevity was initially lacking with the storms, producing funnel clouds, brief tornadoes, and hail in southwest Iowa. As the cells moved northeast and matured, larger hail began to fall with golf ball sized hail falling in Adams county and baseball sized hail into Adair county. Following this period of large hail the storms produced a tornado which would remain on the ground for just over 70 miles, carving a path across central Iowa from southwest of Winterset to just northeast of Newton. The tornado peaked in Winterset, Iowa, producing EF-4 damage with wind speeds estimated near 170 mph. The tornado continued across the southern portion of the Des Moines metro area and to Newton. This is the furthest north EF-4 tornado in the CONUS this early in the year on record, the first EF-4 tornado in Iowa since October 4, 2013 which occurred in Woodbury and Cherokee Counties, and is the second longest tornado in Iowa since 1980, behind the longest occurring on June 7, 1984 at a length of 117 miles across southern Iowa. As the storm skimmed the southern Des Moines metro, cells across south central became tornadic, producing several destructive tornadoes including an EF-3 tornado in Chariton, Iowa. This heartbreaking day resulted in seven fatalities, six in Winterset and one in Chariton, making it the deadliest tornado outbreak in Iowa since 2008. At 15 tornadoes, this is also one of the earliest outbreaks of this magnitude to occur so early in the season.",182

A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, |there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and |uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were |overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado |continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area |north of Randall Road. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Sharkey County were 195 mph. The total path length was 59.35 miles across the four counties. An estimated 165 injuries were caused by this tornado, including 150 in Sharkey County and 15 in Humphreys County.","In the afternoon and evening of the 24th, clusters of strong to severe storms were stretched from southwest to northeast across southeastern Arkansas as robust instability and very strong wind shear served to produce a volatile severe weather environment. To the east in Mississippi, storm activity proved to be more isolated as deep convection struggled develop across the state. With much of the area not being convectively overturned, an area of thunderstorm activity near the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, MS began to become stronger and took advantage of the open warm sector environment, well east of the competitive storm environment to the west that had thus far impeded tornado development. This area of thunderstorm activity quickly consolidated into an organized supercell and produced a family of long track, strong to violent tornadoes from the Mississippi Delta, across central Mississippi, and finally into portions of northeast Mississippi. This cyclical tornado-producing supercell was responsible for the vast majority of severe weather reports from the day and would claim 22 lives across the state. Dozens more were injured, and hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed by these tornadoes. Having wrought widespread destruction across the area, this tornado event by most any measure represents a historic degree of devastation for the state of Mississippi and the region at large.",53

The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line.","On the evening of Friday, December 10, 2021, a potent storm system moving across the central United States resulted in significant long-track tornadoes. A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.",104
