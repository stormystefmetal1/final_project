Tornado Analysis Project

Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze tornado data to understand the energy dynamics and impacts of tornadoes across different Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale categories. Using the datasets, we calculate kinetic energy, classify tornadoes, and visualize trends in their impacts (deaths, injuries, and property damages).
